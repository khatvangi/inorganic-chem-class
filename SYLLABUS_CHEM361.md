## Course Description

An introduction to the chemistry of inorganic compounds, covering atomic structure, periodic trends, main group chemistry, symmetry and group theory, coordination chemistry, electronic structure of transition metal complexes, and solid state chemistry. Emphasis on connecting quantum mechanical foundations to observable properties and reactivity.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Apply periodic trends to predict chemical behavior of elements
2. Describe bonding and structure in main group compounds
3. Assign point groups and apply group theory to molecular properties
4. Name coordination compounds and identify their isomers
5. Use crystal field theory to explain color, magnetism, and stability
6. Describe crystal structures and calculate lattice energies

## Learner-Centered Pedagogy: The Knowledge Funnel

### Why This Course Is Different

Traditional chemistry courses follow a textbook's chapter order: Chapter 1 → 2 → 3 → ... You read sequentially and hope the connections become clear eventually. But this raises a problem: *Why am I learning this? How does it connect to what I actually want to understand?*

This course uses a **Knowledge Funnel** approach that puts your questions at the center.

### How It Was Built

We analyzed **7 inorganic chemistry textbooks** (over 8,700 passages) to extract:
- Every concept mentioned
- How concepts depend on each other (prerequisites)
- Which foundational ideas support which advanced topics

This created a **knowledge graph**: 5,380 concepts connected by 2,885 prerequisite relationships. We then organized concepts into four knowledge scales:

| Scale | What It Contains |
|-------|------------------|
| **QUANTUM** | Orbitals, wave functions, electron configuration |
| **ELECTRONIC** | Bonding theory, crystal field, spectroscopy |
| **STRUCTURAL** | Geometry, symmetry, crystal structures |
| **DESCRIPTIVE** | Periodic trends, reactivity, properties |

The course schedule follows this data-driven structure: foundational concepts (QUANTUM) come first, building toward the phenomena you observe (DESCRIPTIVE).

### How to Use It

Visit **https://chem361.thebeakers.com** and use the Knowledge Funnel:

1. **Ask any question** — "Why is copper sulfate blue?" or "How does magnetism work in complexes?"

2. **See the funnel** — The system traces backward through all prerequisites needed to answer your question

3. **Identify gaps** — If a concept in the funnel is unfamiliar, that's where to focus your study

4. **Learn in order** — Start from the wide base (fundamentals) and work up to your answer

### Why This Helps You

| Traditional Approach | Knowledge Funnel Approach |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Start at Chapter 1 regardless of your question | Start from YOUR question |
| Prerequisites are hidden | Prerequisites are visible |
| One explanation depth | Zoom between 4 knowledge scales |
| "Trust the textbook order" | See WHY each concept matters |
| Teacher-centered | **Learner-centered** |

You are not a passive recipient of information in a fixed sequence. You are an active explorer who can:
- Enter any question and see its conceptual foundation
- Click any concept to explore its own prerequisites
- Understand exactly what you need to learn and why

The syllabus schedule below is designed so that when you reach a topic, you have already covered its prerequisites. But the Knowledge Funnel lets you verify this yourself and fill any gaps on your own terms.
