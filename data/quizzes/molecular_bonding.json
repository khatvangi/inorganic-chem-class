    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "O₂ has the electron configuration (σ2s)²(σ*2s)²(σ2p)²(π2p)⁴(π*2p)². Bond order = ½(8 bonding − 4 antibonding) = 2. This matches the experimentally observed double bond.",

    "explanation": "s–p mixing is significant for the early Period 2 diatomics (Li₂ through N₂), where the 2s and 2p energy gap is relatively small. For O₂ and F₂, the increased nuclear charge widens the 2s–2p gap, reducing s–p mixing. The result is that σ2p lies above π2p for Li₂–N₂, but below π2p for O₂–F₂.",

    "explanation": "A π bond is formed by the side-on (lateral) overlap of p orbitals (or d orbitals).

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "O₂²⁻ has 14 valence electrons (12 from O₂ + 2 extra). Configuration: (σ2s)²(σ*2s)²(σ2p)²(π2p)⁴(π*2p)⁴. Bond order = ½(8 − 6) = 1. The peroxide ion has a single bond, consistent with its longer O–O distance (149 pm vs. 121 pm for O₂).",
    "hints": [
      "O₂²⁻ has two more electrons than O₂. They fill the remaining π* orbitals.",
      "Filling all π* orbitals brings the antibonding count up significantly."

    "question": "For effective MO formation, which condition must the combining atomic orbitals satisfy?",
    "options": [
      "They must be on the same atom",
      "They must have similar energy and appropriate symmetry for overlap",
      "They must both be s orbitals",
      "They must have identical quantum numbers"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Two conditions are required for effective LCAO: (1) the atomic orbitals must have compatible symmetry to allow net overlap, and (2) they must be similar in energy. If the energy difference is too large, the interaction is weak and the resulting MO barely differs from the parent AO. This is why H 1s interacts with F 2p but not with F 2s in HF.",
    "hints": [
      "Orbitals that are very different in energy mix poorly.",
      "Symmetry determines whether the overlap integral is zero or non-zero."
