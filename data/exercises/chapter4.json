      "text": "The Kapustinskii equation shows that lattice enthalpies are inversely proportional to the interionic distances. Later work has shown that further simplification of the Kapustinskii equation allows lattice enthalpies to be estimated from the molecular (formula) unit volume (the unit cell volume divided by the number of formula units, Z, that it contains) or the mass density (see, for example, H.D.B. Jenkins and D. Tudela, J. Chem. Educ., 2003, 80, 1482). How would you expect the lattice enthalpy to vary as a function of (a) the molecular unit volume and (b) the mass density? Given the following unit cell volumes (all in cubic angstroms, \u00c53; 1\u2009\u00c5\u2009=\u200910\u221210\u2009m) for the alkaline earth carbonates MCO3 and oxides, predict the observed decomposition behaviour of the carbonates.
