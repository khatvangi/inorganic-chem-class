This \u2018descriptive chemistry\u2019 of the elements reveals a rich tapestry of patterns and trends, many of which can be rationalized and explained by application of the concepts developed in Part 1. The first chapter of this part of the text, Chapter 9, summarizes the trends and patterns in the properties of the elements and their compounds in the context of the periodic table and the principles described in Part 1. The trends described in this chapter are illustrated throughout the following chapters. Chapter 10 deals with the chemistry of the unique element hydrogen. The following eight chapters (Chapters 11\u221218) proceed systematically across the main groups of the periodic table. The elements of these groups demonstrate the diversity, intricacy, and fascinating nature of inorganic chemistry. The chemical properties of the d-block elements are so diverse and extensive that the next four \u00adchapters of this part are devoted to them. Chapter 19 reviews the descriptive chemistry of the three series of d-block elements. Chapter 20 describes how electronic structure affects the chemical and physical properties of the d-metal complexes and Chapter 21 describes their reactions in solution. Chapter 22 deals with the industrially vital d-metal organometallic compounds. Our tour of the \u00adperiodic table draws to a close in Chapter 23 with an account of the important and unusual properties of the f-block elements. Throughout these chapters Boxes are included that highlight the exciting, contemporary chemistry and applications of the elements in the Group. These Boxes have been fully updated and expanded.
