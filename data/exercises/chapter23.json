U N U N N N U N N N N U N U N N N U U N N N U N PART 3 Expanding our horizons: advances and applications Inorganic chemistry is advancing rapidly at its frontiers, especially where research impinges on other disciplines such as the life sciences, condensed-matter physics, materials science, and environmental chemistry. These swiftly developing fields also represent many areas of inorganic chemistry where new types of compounds are used in catalysis, electronics, and pharmaceuticals. The aim of this section of the book is to demonstrate the vigorous nature of contemporary inorganic chemistry by building on the introductory and descriptive material in Parts 1 and 2. These chapters open with a discussion in Chapter 24 of materials chemistry, focusing on solid-state compounds, their synthesis, structure, and electronic, magnetic, and optical properties. Important ap\u00ad plications of these solid materials include optoelectronics, renewable energy generation and storage, and heterogeneous catalysis using porous materials. Nanomaterials chemistry is also included here\u2014 an area that has developed enormously in the past decade. In Chapter 25 we highlight the important role that inorganic chemistry is playing in promoting environmentally sustainable technologies in industry. Green chemistry pioneers are striving to exploit the many properties of different elements and their compounds in order to improve energy efficiency, reduce waste, and minimize use of hazardous materials. The final two chapters focus on the relationships between inorganic chemistry and living organisms. Chapter 26 discusses the natural roles of different elements in biological systems and the various and extraordinarily subtle ways in which each one is exploited. Evolution has selected the most suitable element for each application, be it transport, signalling, sensing, catalysis or solid-state systems, and produced molecules and materials having exquisite structures and unique properties. Metalloenzymes are highly active and selective catalysts and it is important to establish their modes of action and gain insight to help design new catalysts for technology. Finally, Chapter 27 describes how medical science is exploiting the \u2018stranger\u2019 elements, such as platinum, gold, lithium, arsenic and synthetic technetium, to diagnose and treat illness.",
