      "text": "Spectroscopic evidence has been obtained for the existence of [Ir(C5H5)(H3)(PR3)]+, a complex in which one ligand is formally H3 +. Devise a plausible molecular orbital scheme for the bonding in the complex, assuming that an angular H3 unit occupies one coordination site and interacts with the eg and t2g orbitals of the metal. An alternative formulation of the structure of the complex, however, is as a trihydro species with very large coupling constants (see J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1991, 113, 6074 and the references therein, and especially J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1990, 112, 909 and 920). Review the evidence for this alternative formulation.",

By referring also to Section 5.10, explain the principles of this reaction, the procedures used to investigate the mechanism, and the possible implications for H2 storage.",
