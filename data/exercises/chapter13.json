(b)\u2002 The increase in chemical hardness on going down the group is illustrated by greater oxophilicity and fluorophilicity for the heavier elements. (c)\u2002 The Lewis acidity increases for BX3 from X = F to Br and this may be explained by stronger Br\u2013B \u03c0 bonding. (d)\u2002 Arachno-boron hydrides have a 2(n + 3) skeletal electron count and they are more stable than nido-boron hydrides. (e)\u2002 In a series of nido-boron hydrides acidity increases with increasing size. (f)\u2002 Layered boron nitride is similar in structure to graphite and, because it has a small separation between HOMO and LUMO, it is a good electrical conductor.",
