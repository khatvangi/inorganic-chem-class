      "text": "DDT was one of the first synthetic pesticides and was widely used as an effective control measure for malaria, typhoid, and other insect-borne diseases during World War II. During the 1950s\u20131960s it became very widely used for insect control on crops, in animals, and in the home. However, it was banned in the 1970s and the subsequent furore led to changes in legislation in many countries. Discuss the history of DDT, the problems it caused, and legislation stimulated by the case. Describe in what circumstances DDT is currently recommended for use.",

What changes in legislation were introduced in Europe following these cases?",

Outline how the modified catalysts were prepared and characterized. What reactions occurred in the reactor in addition to catalytic cracking? Which reactions led to aromatic products? Which of the modified catalysts produced most coke build-up? Explain why this did not deactivate the catalyst.",
