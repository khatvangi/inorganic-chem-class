Excess CO gives a five- coordinate species and treatment with NaBH4 in ethanol gives [IrH(CO)2(PPh3)2]. Derive a formal name for Vaska\u2019s compound.

When the pink solid is heated, it loses 1\u2009mol H2O to give a purple solid with the same ratio of NH3:Cl:Co. The purple solid, on dissolution and titration with AgNO3, releases two of its chlorides rapidly. Deduce the structures of the two octahedral complexes and draw and name them.",

On boiling a solution, it becomes violet and has a molar electrical conductivity similar to that of [Co(NH3)6]Cl3. By contrast, another form of CrCl3\u00b76H2O is green and has a lower molar conductivity in solution. If a dilute acidified solution of the green complex is allowed to stand for several hours, it turns violet. Interpret these observations with structural diagrams.",

This complex does not react with 1,2-diaminoethane to give a chelated complex. Name and draw the structure of the diaqua complex. A third isomer of composition PtCl2\u00b72NH3 is an insoluble solid that, when ground with AgNO3, gives a mixture containing [Pt(NH3)4] (NO3)2 and a new solid phase of composition Ag2[PtCl4]. Give the structures and names of each of the three Pt(II) compounds.",

On addition of HCl to a solution of this salt, a gas is rapidly evolved and the solution slowly turns violet on heating. Complete evaporation of the violet solution yields CoCl3\u00b74NH3. When this product is heated in concentrated HCl, a green salt can be isolated with composition CoCl3\u00b74NH3\u00b7HCl. Write balanced equations for all the transformations occurring after the air oxidation. Give as much information as possible concerning the isomerism occurring, and the basis of your reasoning. Is it helpful to know that the form of [Co(Cl)2(en)2]+ that is resolvable into enantiomers is violet?",
