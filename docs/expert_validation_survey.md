# Expert Validation Survey: CHEM 361 Curriculum Structure

**Purpose:** Validate data-driven curriculum ordering derived from knowledge graph analysis of 7 inorganic chemistry textbooks.

**Background:** We extracted prerequisite relationships from textbook content and used graph analysis to identify:
- **Foundations:** Topics with no IC-level prerequisites that enable many other topics
- **Capstones:** Topics where many prerequisite paths converge (integration points)

## Instructions

For each topic, rate whether you agree with its classification.

**Scale:** 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly Agree

## Section A: Proposed Foundations

These topics were identified as having NO prerequisites at the IC level but enabling many other topics.
The "Out-degree" indicates how many topics directly depend on this foundation.

| # | Topic | Out-degree | Rating (1-5) | Comments |
|---|-------|------------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | Coordination Chemistry Fundamentals | 40 | ___ | |
| 2 | Electron Configuration | 25 | ___ | |
| 3 | Oxidation States | 17 | ___ | |
| 4 | Ionic Bonding | 16 | ___ | |
| 5 | Group Theory Basics | 11 | ___ | |
| 6 | Quantum Mechanics Basics | 10 | ___ | |
| 7 | Thermodynamics | 9 | ___ | |
| 8 | Ligand Field Theory | 9 | ___ | |
| 9 | Understanding Of Atomic Structure | 9 | ___ | |
| 10 | Quantum Numbers | 8 | ___ | |
| 11 | Coordination Complexes | 8 | ___ | |
| 12 | Atomic Structure Basics | 8 | ___ | |
| 13 | Periodic Table Trends | 7 | ___ | |
| 14 | Symmetry Operations | 7 | ___ | |
| 15 | Oxidation States Of Transition Metals | 7 | ___ | |

## Section B: Proposed Capstones

These topics were identified as integration endpoints where many prerequisite paths converge.
The "In-degree" indicates how many prerequisite topics lead to this capstone.

| # | Topic | In-degree | Rating (1-5) | Comments |
|---|-------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | Main Group Chemistry | 368 | ___ | |
| 2 | Coordination Chemistry | 157 | ___ | |
| 3 | Solid State Chemistry | 107 | ___ | |
| 4 | Solid-State And Materials Chemistry | 10 | ___ | |
| 5 | Symmetry and Group Theory | 10 | ___ | |

## Section C: Sample Bridge Topics

For comparison, these topics were classified as "bridges" (connect foundations to capstones).

| # | Topic | In | Out | Agree it's a bridge? |
|---|-------|----|----|---------------------|
| 1 | Crystal Structures Of Metals | 2 | 2 | Yes / No |
| 2 | Non-Aqueous Solvents | 2 | 1 | Yes / No |
| 3 | Homogeneous Catalysis | 1 | 1 | Yes / No |
| 4 | Thermodynamics Of Redox Reactions | 1 | 1 | Yes / No |
| 5 | Stereochemistry | 2 | 1 | Yes / No |
| 6 | Electronic Configurations | 1 | 2 | Yes / No |
| 7 | Quantum Mechanics | 1 | 3 | Yes / No |
| 8 | Solid-State Structures | 1 | 2 | Yes / No |
| 9 | Surface Chemistry | 1 | 1 | Yes / No |
| 10 | Defects In Crystals | 2 | 1 | Yes / No |

## Section D: Key Finding Validation

**Our analysis suggests Main Group Chemistry should be taught LAST (as a capstone) rather than early.**

Rationale: Main Group Chemistry has in-degree=55 (many prerequisites converge there) and out-degree=0 (nothing depends on it at the IC level). It integrates:
- Periodic trends
- Oxidation states  
- Bonding theories
- Redox chemistry

**Do you agree?**

[ ] Strongly Agree - Main Group should be a capstone
[ ] Agree - Makes pedagogical sense
[ ] Neutral
[ ] Disagree - Main Group should come earlier
[ ] Strongly Disagree - Main Group must be taught first

**Comments:**
