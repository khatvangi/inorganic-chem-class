        <!-- THE PREDICTION -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Prediction Machine</h2>

            <p>In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev published his periodic table with several gaps. Where element 31 should have been, he wrote "eka-aluminum" and listed its properties: atomic weight around 68, density near 5.9 g/cm³, a metal that would melt at low temperature and form a volatile chloride. Four years later, Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran isolated gallium from zinc ore. Its atomic weight was 69.7. Its density was 5.91 g/cm³. It melted at 29.8°C, warm enough to liquefy in your hand.</p>

            <p>Mendeleev had never seen this element, never measured its properties, never performed a single experiment with it. He predicted its behavior from its position in the table alone. The periodic table encodes patterns so reliable that chemists can deduce properties of elements before they are discovered. Understanding why those patterns exist transforms the table from a filing system into a prediction engine.</p>

        <!-- EFFECTIVE NUCLEAR CHARGE -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Effective Nuclear Charge</h2>

            <p>A lithium atom has three protons pulling on its electrons. A sodium atom has eleven. If nuclear charge alone determined atomic properties, sodium should grip its electrons more tightly and be smaller than lithium. It is not. Sodium is larger, and its outer electron is easier to remove. Something reduces the pull that outer electrons feel.</p>

            <p>The field arising from a spherical distribution of charge is equivalent to the field generated by a single point charge at the center. Inner electrons create such a distribution between the nucleus and the outer electron. Their negative charge reduces the nuclear charge from Z to an effective value, Z<sub>eff</sub>. This reduction is called shielding.</p>

            <div class="equation">
                Z<sub>eff</sub> = Z − σ
            </div>

            <p>The shielding constant σ depends on which orbitals the inner electrons occupy. An electron in a 2s orbital can penetrate through the 1s shell, approaching the nucleus closely and experiencing nearly the full nuclear charge. A 2p electron cannot penetrate as effectively because its wavefunction goes to zero at the nucleus. The 2p electron is more fully shielded by the core and experiences a lower Z<sub>eff</sub>.</p>

            <p>This explains why, in a many-electron atom, a 2s electron has lower energy than a 2p electron despite both having the same principal quantum number. The 2s penetrates the core, feels more nuclear charge, and is bound more tightly.</p>

            <h3>Slater's Rules</h3>

            <p>John Slater analyzed experimental data and found consistent patterns in shielding. His rules assign contributions to σ based on which shells electrons occupy relative to the electron of interest:</p>

            </table>
            <p class="source-note">For d and f electrons, different values apply. See Slater, Phys. Rev. 1930.</p>

            <p>Consider oxygen. Its nuclear charge is 8. The outermost 2p electron sees five other electrons in the second shell (each contributing 0.35) and two 1s electrons (each contributing 0.85). The shielding constant is 5×0.35 + 2×0.85 = 3.45. The effective nuclear charge is 8 − 3.45 = 4.55. The outer electron feels barely half the true nuclear charge.</p>

        <!-- ATOMIC RADII -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Atomic Radii</h2>

            <p>Atomic radii increase down a group and decrease from left to right across a period. Across a period, the combined effects of penetration and shielding produce an increase in effective nuclear charge. Each added proton increases Z, but each added electron enters the same shell and shields imperfectly. The growing Z<sub>eff</sub> draws electrons inward, producing smaller atoms. Descending a group, electrons occupy successive shells outside a completed core. Even though Z increases, the new shell extends further from the nucleus, and radii increase.</p>

            </div>

            <p>The competition between increasing nuclear charge and increasing principal quantum number is won by the latter when moving down a group. Cesium is enormous compared to lithium, not because its nucleus is weak (55 protons), but because its valence electron occupies the sixth shell.</p>

            <h3>The Scandide Contraction</h3>

            <p>Crossing the first transition series from scandium to zinc, we fill the 3d orbitals. These d electrons screen the 4s electrons poorly. The 3d orbitals are relatively diffuse and do not penetrate close to the nucleus. They fail to shield the outer electrons effectively from the growing nuclear charge. The result appears in period 4: gallium (Z=31) has nearly the same covalent radius as aluminum (Z=13), despite having 18 more protons.</p>

        <!-- LANTHANIDE CONTRACTION -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Lanthanide Contraction</h2>

            <p>The elements of the third transition series (period 6) are preceded by the lanthanoids, in which fourteen 4f electrons are added. These 4f orbitals have poor shielding properties. The f electrons lie deep within the atom and do not effectively screen outer electrons from the nuclear charge. As we cross from lanthanum to lutetium, Z<sub>eff</sub> experienced by the outer electrons increases steadily.</p>

            <p>The consequence is remarkable. Atomic radii in the 5d series are nearly identical to their congeners in the 4d series, even though period 6 atoms have 32 more electrons. Molybdenum and tungsten, separated by 32 protons and 32 electrons, have covalent radii of 154 and 162 pm respectively. Zirconium and hafnium both have radii of 175 pm.</p>

            </div>

            <p>The contraction has practical consequences. Zirconium and hafnium were not separated until 1923, and even then it required thousands of fractional crystallizations. Their chemical similarity makes separation extraordinarily difficult. The third-row transition metals are also denser than simple extrapolation would predict, because the lanthanide contraction packs more mass into roughly the same volume.</p>

        <!-- RELATIVISTIC EFFECTS -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Relativistic Effects</h2>

            <p>For light elements, relativistic corrections to electron behavior are negligible. For heavy elements with high atomic numbers, they become significant and can reduce atomic size by approximately 20 percent.</p>

            <p>Electrons in s orbitals have nonzero probability density at the nucleus. In heavy atoms, these electrons move at velocities approaching the speed of light. According to special relativity, their mass increases. A more massive electron orbits closer to the nucleus, and the s orbitals contract. This contraction is most pronounced for the 6s orbital in elements like gold, mercury, and lead.</p>

            <p>The contracted 6s orbital shields the nucleus more effectively. As a result, d and f electrons experience reduced nuclear attraction and their orbitals expand. The d and f electrons become more diffuse and less effective at shielding other electrons, which causes further contraction of the outermost s orbital.</p>

            <h3>Why Gold Is Golden</h3>

            <p>Silver and gold have similar electron configurations: [Kr]4d¹⁰5s¹ and [Xe]4f¹⁴5d¹⁰6s¹. Silver is white because all visible wavelengths are reflected equally. Gold absorbs blue light and reflects yellow and red. The difference arises from relativistic effects. In gold, the 6s orbital is contracted and stabilized while the 5d orbitals are expanded and destabilized. The energy gap between the 5d and 6s levels shrinks until transitions between them fall in the visible range. Gold absorbs blue light (the 5d→6s transition) and appears golden.</p>

            <h3>Why Mercury Is Liquid</h3>

            <p>Mercury melts at −39°C, the only metal liquid at room temperature. The relativistic contraction of its 6s² electrons makes them unavailable for metallic bonding. The filled 5d¹⁰ shell contributes nothing to the metallic bond. With its bonding electrons contracted close to the nucleus and unwilling to overlap with neighboring atoms, mercury forms weak metallic bonds and melts at remarkably low temperature.</p>

        <!-- INERT PAIR EFFECT -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Inert Pair Effect</h2>

            <p>Carbon and silicon possess inner noble gas shells that efficiently screen their valence electrons from the nuclear charge. This promotes hybridization and bonding. Carbon and silicon rarely exhibit the +2 oxidation state.</p>

            <p>Germanium, tin, and lead differ. Their atoms possess inner 18-electron shells (s²p⁶d¹⁰) that screen the valence electrons less efficiently. The ns² electron pair becomes stabilized. The dipositive state first appears definitively with germanium and grows increasingly important down the group.</p>

            <p>The high nuclear charge of lead, combined with the poor shielding from its filled 4f and 5d subshells, results in strong stabilization of the 6s² pair. This is the inert pair effect. Lead(II) is more stable than lead(IV). Compounds of lead(IV) are strong oxidizing agents, readily accepting electrons to achieve the more stable +2 state.</p>

            <p class="source-note">From Basset, Inorganic Chemistry</p>

            <p>The same pattern appears in groups 13 and 15. Thallium prefers +1 over +3. The direct reaction of thallium with halogens produces TlX, not TlX₃. Bismuth prefers +3, and Bi₂O₅ does not exist under normal conditions while Bi₂O₃ is stable.</p>

            <p>The cause is twofold. More energy is required to promote or ionize the 6s electrons because they are relativistically stabilized. But the energy recovered upon forming bonds is diminished because the contracted 6s orbital overlaps poorly with ligand orbitals. The energy investment is not worthwhile, and the pair remains inert.</p>

                <p>PbO₂ is used as an oxidizing agent. What happens to lead's oxidation state when PbO₂ acts as an oxidizer?</p>

                <div class="quiz-answer" id="pb-ans">
                    <p>Correct. PbO₂ contains Pb(IV), which is unstable due to the inert pair effect. When PbO₂ oxidizes another substance, it accepts electrons and lead is reduced to the more stable +2 state.</p>

        <!-- THE f-BLOCK -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>The f-Block</h2>

            <p>Fifteen elements from lanthanum to lutetium show remarkably similar chemistry. All favor the +3 oxidation state. Their ionic radii decrease smoothly across the series. They are extraordinarily difficult to separate, requiring ion-exchange chromatography.</p>

            <p>The similarity arises because 4f orbitals are buried. They are shielded by filled 5s², 5p⁶ subshells and lie deep inside the atom. The 4f electrons do not extend to the periphery where chemical bonding occurs. Lanthanide chemistry is determined by the outer 5d and 6s electrons, which are nearly identical across the series.</p>

                <tr><td>Yb</td><td>+2</td><td>4f¹⁴</td><td>Filled subshell</td></tr>
            </table>

            <h3>Actinides Are Different</h3>

            <p>The 5f orbitals of the actinides extend further from the nucleus than the 4f orbitals of the lanthanides. They participate more in bonding. Uranium shows oxidation states from +3 to +6, with uranyl (UO₂²⁺) being particularly stable. Actinide bonding has more covalent character than lanthanide bonding.</p>

            <p>Twenty-one elements have electron configurations that differ from simple aufbau predictions. Chromium is [Ar]3d⁵4s¹, not [Ar]3d⁴4s². Copper is [Ar]3d¹⁰4s¹, not [Ar]3d⁹4s². The exchange energy gained from half-filled or filled subshells exceeds the small energy cost of promoting an electron. These are not exceptions to a rule; they reveal that minimizing total energy, not following a filling order, determines electron configuration.</p>
