            <p>The impact of hydrogen bonding is seen clearly in the</p>

            <p>At least nine distinct forms of ice have been identified. At</p>
            <p>0°C and atmospheric pressure, hexagonal ice, Ih, forms (Fig.</p>
            <p>10.7), but between −120 and −140°C the cubic form, Ic,</p>
            <p>is produced. At very high pressures several higher-density</p>

            <p>is usually handled in aqueous solution. The Frost diagram</p>
            <p>for oxygen (Fig. 16.2) shows that H2O2 is a good oxidizing</p>

            <p>Hydrogen sulfide, H2S, is toxic, its toxicity made more haz­</p>
            <p>ardous by the fact that it tends to anaesthetize the olfactory</p>
