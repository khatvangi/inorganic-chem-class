            <h2>Oxidation and reduction</h2>
            <p>A large class of reactions of inorganic compounds can be</p>
            <p>regarded as occurring by the transfer of electrons from one</p>
            <p>species to another. Electron gain is called reduction and</p>
            <p>electron loss is called oxidation; the joint process is called</p>
            <p>a redox reaction. The species that supplies electrons is the</p>
            <p>reducing agent (or ‘reductant’) and the species that removes</p>
            <p>electrons is the oxidizing agent (or ‘oxidant’). Many redox</p>
            <p>reactions release a great deal of energy and they are exploited</p>
            <p>in combustion or battery technologies as well as biology.</p>

            <h2>Reduction potentials</h2>
            <p>Because electrons are transferred between species in redox</p>
            <p>reactions, electrochemical methods (using electrodes to</p>
            <p>measure electron transfer reactions under controlled ther­</p>
            <p>modynamic conditions) are of major importance and lead</p>
            <p>to a scale of ‘standard potentials’ for inorganic species.</p>
            <p>The tendency of an electron to migrate from one species</p>
            <p>to another is expressed in terms of the differences between</p>
            <p>their standard potentials. Techniques such as cyclic voltam­</p>
            <p>metry (Chapter 8) are used to measure reduction potentials</p>
            <p>under different conditions, and extract information about</p>
