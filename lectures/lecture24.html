            <p>As discussed in Section 4.16, all solids contain a level of</p>
            <p>defects—imperfections of structure or composition. It is also</p>
            <p>possible to introduce defects (extrinsic defects) deliberately</p>
            <p>into a material through mechanisms such as doping. These</p>
            <p>defects, which are mainly interstitial (Frenkel-type) or vacan­</p>
            <p>cies (Schottky-type), are important because they influence</p>
            <p>electrical conductivity and chemical reactivity. Electrical con­</p>
            <p>duction can arise from the motion of ions through the solid,</p>
            <p>and this motion is often enhanced by the presence of defects.</p>
