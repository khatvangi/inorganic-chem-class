            <h2>KEY POINT  The use of auxiliary substances in a system should be</h2>

            <p>Solvents are widely used in chemistry and so much chemistry</p>

            <p>toxic, flammable or volatile and in such cases finding safer</p>
            <p>alternatives is imperative. Solvents are also responsible for</p>
            <p>much of the energy used in a chemical synthesis. They have</p>
            <p>to be heated, filtered, distilled, refluxed, pumped, and, ide­</p>
            <p>ally, recovered and recycled. So finding synthetic routes that</p>

            <h2>KEY POINT  Whenever possible, raw materials and feedstocks for</h2>
            <p>chemical reactions and processes should be renewable.</p>
            <p>Humans have made use of fossil fuels and minerals to</p>
            <p>build and power modern society. These are not renewable</p>
            <p>resources and are steadily depleting (Box 25.1). Their use is</p>
            <p>also contributing to the increasing levels of greenhouse gases</p>
            <p>in the atmosphere. The term renewable feedstocks usually</p>
            <p>refers to biological feedstocks. Carbon dioxide is removed</p>
            <p>from the atmosphere through photosynthetic processes to</p>
            <p>grow biomass: trees, crops, plants and algae. This biomass</p>

            <p>This section is very short which reflects the paucity of exam­</p>
            <p>ples from inorganic chemistry rather than the importance of</p>
            <p>the principle. This principle of green chemistry states that</p>

            <p>be minimized in order to reduce waste produced and energy</p>
            <p>consumed. Derivatization can include the use of protecting</p>
            <p>groups during a synthesis to direct the reaction in a specific</p>
