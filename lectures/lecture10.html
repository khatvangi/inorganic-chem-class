            <p>It ranges in character from being a strong Lewis base (the</p>

            <p>There are three isotopes of hydrogen: hydrogen itself (1H),</p>
            <p>deuterium (D, 2H), and tritium (T, 3H); tritium is radioac­</p>
            <p>tive. The lightest isotope, 1H (very occasionally called pro­</p>
            <p>tium), is by far the most abundant. Deuterium has variable</p>
            <p>natural abundance with an average value of about 16 atoms</p>
            <p>in 100 000. Tritium occurs to the extent of only 1 atom in</p>

            <p>Hydrogen’s unique properties distinguish it from all other</p>
            <p>elements in the periodic table. It is often placed at the head</p>
            <p>of Group 1 because like the alkali metals it has only one</p>
            <p>electron in its valence shell. That position, however, does</p>
            <p>not truly reflect the chemical or physical properties of the</p>
            <p>element. In particular, its ionization energy is far higher than</p>
            <p>the other Group 1 elements, so hydrogen is not a metal,</p>

            <h2>KEY POINTS  Hydrogen compounds of the most electropositive</h2>
            <p>metals may be regarded as ionic hydrides; they liberate H2 in contact</p>
            <p>with Brønsted acids and transfer H− to electrophiles. As direct hydride</p>

            <p>The saline hydrides are ionic solids containing discrete H−</p>
            <p>ions and are analogous to corresponding halide salts. The</p>
            <p>ionic radius of H− varies from 126 pm in LiH to 154 pm</p>
