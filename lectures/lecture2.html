            <p>In 1916 G.N. Lewis proposed that a covalent bond is</p>

            <p>pair. A single bond, a shared electron pair (A:B), is denoted</p>
            <p>A−B; likewise, a double bond, two shared electron pairs</p>
            <p>(A::B), is denoted A=B, and a triple bond, three shared</p>
            <p>pairs of electrons (A:::B), is denoted A≡B. An unshared pair</p>
            <p>of valence electrons on an atom (A:) is called a lone pair.</p>
            <p>Although lone pairs do not contribute directly to the bond­</p>
