            <p>In the 1920s, N.V. Sidgwick recognized that the metal atom</p>
            <p>in a simple metal carbonyl, such as [Ni(CO)4] (2), has the</p>
            <p>same valence electron count (18) as the noble gas that termi­</p>
            <p>nates the long period to which the metal belongs. Sidgwick</p>
            <p>coined the term ‘inert gas rule’ for this indication of stabil­</p>
            <p>ity, but it is now usually referred to as the 18-electron rule.1</p>

            <p>The dominance of 16- and 18-electron configurations in</p>

            <p>For the sake of counting electrons, each metal atom and</p>
