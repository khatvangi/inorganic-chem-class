            <h2>Acids and bases</h2>
            <p>The original distinction between acids and bases was based, haz­</p>
            <p>ardously, on criteria of taste and feel: acids were sour and bases</p>
            <p>felt soapy. A deeper chemical understanding of their properties</p>
            <p>emerged from Arrhenius’s (1884) conception of an acid as a</p>

            <p>it is always associated with other species. A simple representation of a</p>
            <p>hydrogen ion in water is as the hydronium ion, H3O+.</p>
            <p>England proposed (in 1923) that the essential feature of</p>
            <p>an acid–base reaction is the transfer of a hydrogen ion, H+,</p>
            <p>from one species to another. In the context of this definition,</p>
            <p>a hydrogen ion is often referred to as a proton. They sug­</p>
            <p>gested that any substance that acts as a proton donor should</p>
            <p>be classified as an acid, and any substance that acts as a pro­</p>

            <p>bonding is more important among the Period 2 elements, so</p>
